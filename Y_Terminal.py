How to use the Y_Terminal:

    You enter in commands by typing the commands and pressing the enter key.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Historical analysis tool (-a):

    The usage of this tool is to enter in the ticker of the stock/cryptocurrency/index that you want to analyze,
    as it is listed on finance.yahoo.com. So if you are unsure of what the ticker for Bitcoin is, you would
    go to finance.yahoo.com and type in Bitcoin. The ticker for the price of Bitcoin in U.S dollars is (BTC-USD).

    The exact process of analysis is as follows:
    
        1. All of the monthly price data (on finance.yahoo.com) for the tickers entered is collected and stored.
        2. Monthly return on investment based solely on price is calculated for each of the tickers.
        3. All dividend data is collected for each of the tickers.
        4. The monthly average and standard deviation of returns is calculated for each of the tickers, as well
        as expected monthly dividends.
        5. (4.) is repeated, but for a yearly timeframe.
        6. A probability distribution of returns is created for a monthly and yearly timeframe, based on the
        Standard Normal Table.

    For this version you can analyze up to three (3) tickers at once.
